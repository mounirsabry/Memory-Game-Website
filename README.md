# Memory-Game-Website
A simple enjoyable memory game using vanilla HTML, CSS, Javascript.

A simple assignment spiked my attention, a simple memory game where the user can view two cards, any if they match
They will stay visible, if no match, the cards will be flipped down again.
The game ends when the user successfully matches all the cards.

I updated the application to have the following features.
1. Responsive design, the UI will scale up and down based on the current window size.
2. The user can choose the difficuly, which represented by the number of cards.
3. One difficulty is already choosen for the user, the user can just press start.
4. The cards contains images instead of plain numbers.
5. An animation for the flipping of the card will be played when the user flip a card.
6. A message will be displayed when the user finishes the game.
7. A timer in the bottom represents the time the user took to finish the game (in seconds), the timer is stopped when the game is finished, reset when restarted.
8. The user can just start another game in middle of the current game or after finishing the game.
9. relaxing interface, I customized the UI as best as I can to give a relaxing feel when playing the game.
